    <ul>
      <li><b>Line 11: </b>How is this the code block below different from the above block? They both log the same? But is it how you would use the object/values later on?</li>
      <li><b>Line 63: </b>Does it matter if it's artistArr.push(collection[i].artist)? I feel like it does but not sure why? One is the argument that's passed and the latter is
          the location of the value. The output values are the same but where they come from are different?</li>
